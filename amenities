      <h2>Playground</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Our community playground is an indispensable gathering space for children and parents. Community playgrounds provide children the opportunity to practice and hone key social and physical skills. Children are constantly learning through play—making new friends, sharing, taking turns and interacting with other children. This increased interaction with children of all backgrounds and abilities gives kids a more open view of the world and the opportunity to build new relationships.</p>

      <h2>Gatehouse</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Alaqua Lakes is a private gated community staffed with security personnel. Because it is more difficult to access than a standard community, criminal activity is reduced and solicitors have a more difficult (if not impossible) time bothering residents. In fact, the only solicitors you’ll probably get will be neighborhood kids trying to sell you magazines and girl scout cookies.</p>

      <h2>7-acre Community Park</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Residents can enjoy the amenities of a unique 7-acre community park, including an open-air Pavilion that is perfect for community and private gatherings or a simple family picnic. Our multi-purpose field may be used for soccer or baseball, and is the perfect place for families to enjoy sports activities together. Adults and children alike will enjoy shooting hoops on the basketball courts or playing a game of volleyball on the soft, sandy volleyball court. Little ones will delight in the fully equipped playground, which provides two play areas, a swing set and play equipment for crawling, climbing and sliding.</p>
