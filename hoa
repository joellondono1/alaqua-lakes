      <h2>Homeowners Association</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The Alaqua Lakes Community Association Inc. is the homeowner's Association (HOA) for Alaqua Lakes. It functions both as the legal governing entity (a not-for-profit Florida corporation) and the overall property manager for our community. The legal definition of the Association, along with the community's Covenants, conditions, restrictions, and easements, are outlined within the Alaqua Lakes governing documents available on this website under "Your Association". The HOA's purpose is to maintain the common property, oversee the business activities, and enforce the covenants and conditions, restrictions, and easements of Alaqua Lakes.</p>
      <p>An elected Board of Directors governs the HOA, and the day-to-day management of the community is outsourced to a commercial property management company, currently Sentry Management. Our Community Association Manager from Sentry Management is Lindsey Thigpen. Several standing committees assist the Board of Directors in carrying out their duties by overseeing various functions that are important to the community. Since the Board approves and oversees all committee activities, a Board member is generally assigned as Chairman for each committee and is responsible for keeping the Board up to date on the committee's activities.</p>
